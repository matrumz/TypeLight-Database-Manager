# TypeLite-Database-Manager
A Typescript-SQLite interface for generating version-control-friendly database representations and deploying these generated files as new databases.

## IN DEVELOPMENT
Please note that this package is currently not operational.
I've uploaded it early to build interest, hold the name, and test NPM publishing (this is my first package ever :sweat_smile: ).

Please visit again in the future for functional releases.
Expect working advertised features starting v0.1.0 .
